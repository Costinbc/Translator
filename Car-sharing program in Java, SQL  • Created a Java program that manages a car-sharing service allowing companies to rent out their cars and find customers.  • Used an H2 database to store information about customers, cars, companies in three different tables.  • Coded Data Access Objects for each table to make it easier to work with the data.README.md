Multilingual translator in Python

• Created a Python program that translates words between 13 languages.

• The program prints up to 5 different translations and example sentences, that are also added to a file named <word>.txt.

• Got the translations using HTTP requests to context.reverso.net.

• Inspected the page's HTML and CSS code and extracted the translations using BeautifulSoup.

• Formatted and cleaned the results to make it more readable and easy to print.
